     <h1>What Is Data Analytics?</h1>
<p>Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about information.
 Many of the techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption.

      <b>KEY TAKEAWAYS</b>
Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data to make conclusions about that information.
Data analytics help a business optimize its performance, perform more efficiently, maximize profit, or make more strategically-guided decisions.
The techniques and processes of data analytics have been automated into mechanical processes and algorithms that work over raw data for human consumption. 
Various approaches to data analytics include looking at what happened (descriptive analytics), why something happened (diagnostic analytics),
 what is going to happen (predictive analytics), or what should be done next (prescriptive analytics).
Data analytics relies on a variety of software tools including spreadsheets, data visualization, reporting tools, data mining programs, and open-source languages for the greatest data manipulation.



      <b>Understanding Data Analytics</b>
Data analytics is a broad term that encompasses many diverse types of data analysis. Any type of information can be subjected to data analytics techniques to get insight that can be used to improve things.
 Data analytics techniques can reveal trends and metrics that would otherwise be lost in the mass of information. This information can then be used to optimize processes to increase the overall efficiency of a business or system.

For example, manufacturing companies often record the runtime, downtime, and work queue for various machines and then analyze the data to better plan workloads so the machines operate closer to peak capacity.

Data analytics can do much more than point out bottlenecks in production. Gaming companies use data analytics to set reward schedules for players that keep the majority of players active in the game.
 Content companies use many of the same data analytics to keep you clicking, watching, or re-organizing content to get another view or another click.


       <b>Data Analysis Steps:</b>
The process involved in data analysis involves several steps:

The first step is to determine the data requirements or how the data is grouped. Data may be separated by age, demographic, income, or gender. Data values may be numerical or divided by category.
The second step in data analytics is the process of collecting it. This can be done through a variety of sources such as computers, online sources, cameras, environmental sources, or through personnel.
The data must be organized after it's collected so it can be analyzed. This may take place on a spreadsheet or other form of software that can take statistical data.
The data is then cleaned up before analysis. It's scrubbed and checked to ensure that there's no duplication or error and that it is not incomplete.
 This step helps correct any errors before it goes on to a data analyst to be analyzed.


         <b>Types of Data Analytics:</b>
  <i>Data analytics is broken down into four basic types:</i>

Descriptive analytics: This describes what has happened over a given period of time. Have the number of views gone up? Are sales stronger this month than last?
Diagnostic analytics: This focuses more on why something happened. It involves more diverse data inputs and a bit of hypothesizing. Did the weather affect beer sales? Did that latest marketing campaign impact sales?
Predictive analytics: This moves to what is likely going to happen in the near term. What happened to sales the last time we had a hot summer? How many weather models predict a hot summer this year?
Prescriptive analytics: This suggests a course of action. We should add an evening shift to the brewery and rent an additional tank to increase output
 if the likelihood of a hot summer is measured as an average of these five weather models and the average is above 58%,
