    <h1>What is digital marketing, and why does it matter? That’s precisely what I plan to discuss today.</h1>


    <p>
Digital marketing means using digital channels, like search engines, social media, email, mobile apps, and websites, to promote a product or service. This umbrella term also includes marketing using digital devices such as TV or radio.

Examples of online digital marketing include:

Search engine optimization (SEO): optimizing a website to improve its visibility and ranking on search engines like Google.
Pay-per-click advertising (PPC): paying for advertisements to appear on search engine results pages or social media platforms.
Social media marketing: creating and sharing content on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to increase brand awareness and engagement.
Content marketing: creating and sharing valuable content, such as blog posts, e-books, or videos, thus attracting and retaining a specific audience.
Leveraging traditional offline media for advertising: using radio and TV marketing, billboard advertising, print, and in-person events.
Analysts predict the global digital advertising and marketing sector will reach $786.2 billion by 2026, with clicks and display ads among the most dominant forms.

Then there’s offline digital marketing like:

Out-of-Home Advertising: This involves using billboards, transit ads, or other types of visual media to promote your brand or product. This can be a great way to reach a broad audience and create a strong visual impression.
TV Marketing: where you promote your products in the form as adverts, infomercials, or even demonstrations.
Radio marketing: Trailers and commercials promoting your product to listeners.
In other reports by PR Newswire, digital marketing is worth an estimated $460 billion in the US.

You can do digital marketing online and offline, and using a combination is vital to any well-rounded strategy. These techniques and strategies help businesses to reach their target audience, engage with them, and ultimately convert them into customers.

This guide covers everything you need to know to get started with digital marketing, but first, let’s discuss why it’s so essential to your business.

As a young kid in California, my experiences from the back seat of our car mostly alternated between: “Mom, when are we there?” and “Uh, look, McDonald’s, can we go?” whenever one of those 10-foot billboards popped up on the side of the road.

Growing up with Indian parents, the answer to both of those would, most times, be the same: “Not yet.”

Sometimes, big brands would even start a billboard war, like this one between Audi and BMW, which got quite a few laughs:
