How Soft Skills Work
Soft skills relate to how you work. Soft skills include interpersonal (people) skills,
 communication skills, listening skills, time management, problem-solving, leadership,
  and empathy, among others.1 They are among the top skills employers seek in the candidates
   they hire because soft skills are important for just about every job.

Hiring managers typically look for job candidates with soft skills because they make someone more successful in the workplace.
2 Someone can be excellent with technical, job-specific skills, but if they can't manage their time or work within a team,
 they may not be successful in the workplace.

Soft skills are also important to the success of most employers.
 After all, nearly every job requires employees to engage with others in some way.1

Another reason hiring managers and employers look for applicants with soft skills is 
that soft skills are transferable skills that can be used regardless of the person's job.
 This makes job candidates with soft skills very adaptable and flexible employees.

Alternate names: Interpersonal skills, essential skills, noncognitive skills3

Example of Soft Skills
Soft skills are particularly important in customer-based jobs, for example.
 These employees are in direct contact with customers. It takes several soft
  skills to be able to listen to a customer and provide that customer with helpful and polite service.

Note
Even if you're not in a client-facing role, you need to be able to get along with co-workers,
 managers, vendors, and other people you interact with at work.

 These are much harder to learn, at least in a traditional classroom. They are also much harder to measure and evaluate.
